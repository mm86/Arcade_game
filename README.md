Game rules:

To start the game, open index.html in your browser and double click the avatar of your choice. 

If the player collides with any of the enemy bugs or reaches the water block, a life will be lost. 

To complete the game, the player must collect all the prizes. Once the player collects all the prizes,
a key will appear in their hand. With the key, the player must reach the door to complete the game. 

If the player reaches the door without the key, a life will be lost. 

For movement, use the arrow keys to navigate.
